# Bank-Loan-Analysis-Project

## Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing data from a bank that I found on Kaggle. While I believe the data is generated (as some values seem unusual), it still provides valuable insights into bank loan applications and approvals.

## The project has answers to questions:

- How is the loan amount distributed across different types of employment?
- What is the most common purpose of the loan among the applications?
- Does the success of the application depend on the type of employment?
- How does the loan term affect the probability of success?
- What is the average age of the oldest account among successful applications?
- Does the number of open accounts in the last 12 months affect the probability of success of the application?
- Is there a relationship between the amount of balances on all accounts and the success of the application?
- Which payment status is most common among active accounts?
- How does the number of accounts with defaults affect the probability of obtaining a loan?
- In what period of the year are applications most often submitted?
- Does the average loan amount vary by month and quarter?
- What is the average loan term among submitted applications in each quarter?
- Does the probability of application success change depending on the time of submission?
- What is the average purchase requisition amount for different lending purposes?
- What is the average purchase requisition amount for different credit purposes by month?
- Is there a correlation between the average age of the accounts and the loan amount?
- Is there a relationship between the number of accounts repaid and the loan term?

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of bank loan applications, offering insights into factors affecting loan success rates, loan purposes, seasonal trends, and the relationship between various features in the data. The findings can be useful for understanding customer behavior and optimizing loan approval strategies.
